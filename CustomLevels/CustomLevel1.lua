    For custom levels:
    0 is an empty space
    1 is a generic wall block
    2 is a fake wall that has no collision
    3 is an enemy that moves up and down
    4 is an enemy that moves left and right
    -1 is the position the player will spawn
    -------------------------------------------
    there is no limit to how many levels you can have you can make them go up, down or right
    just make sure the holes in the walls match up on each level or bad things could happen
    i know its a bit hard to figureout what you're doing but i didn't have time to make a level builder
    -------------------------------------------
    2 level layouts is below, change the zeros to different values to see what happens
    one surrounded with barriers
    and a completely empty one

        {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
